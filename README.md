## Sublime Text 3 Plugin for Phing

This plugin is an extension of the [one developed by nLight](https://github.com/nLight/Phing) for Sublime Text 2.  It replaces the xml reader with code that calls phing from within the python script.  This was done primarily because the original was not set up to deal with nested build files - [see phing importtask](http://www.phing.info/docs/guide/stable/chapters/appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html#ImportTask)

This project is under construction.  Installation and usage will be completed once the project is added to [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/)
